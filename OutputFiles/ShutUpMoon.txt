I’m sorry I hurt your feelings when I called you stupid. I really thought you already knew.
It’s ok if you disagree with me. I can’t force you to be right.
I’m busy right now, can I ignore you some other time?
Oh, my bad. I’m sorry for bothering you. I forgot I only exist when you need me for something.
Ignore me, I don’t care I’m used to it anyways, I’m invisible.
